# Creative Major Project - Individual Prototype File

## Introduction
Hello welcome to my individual functioning prototype! 

I am in Tut1 Group C and Iâ€™ve created a group code with Wensi, Viki and Yuchen. We decided to abstract *Wheels of Fortune* by Pacita Abad and here is my take on expanding on the group code.  

Upon seeing my artwork, it would be an empty canvas with a gradient background and meteors dashing diagonally. 
It requires several mouse clicks and key presses interaction to activate the artwork: 

1. To see circles on the canvas, press anywhere using your mouse
2. A prompt will pop up asking you to press a number between 1-4 on your keyboard. The number you choose will determine what circle is outputted.
3. You can resize these circles by clicking in the middle of the circle and dragging your mouse inwards or outwards
4. To clear the canvas, press the space bar
